FireCom-API
===========

API for Washington County and Clackamas County Fire Information Data.

This is an API that scrapes the existing WCCCA information page and archives the data for reporting purposes. 

[Original WCCCA Page](http://www.wccca.com/PITSv2/)

The purpose of this is to archive data for reporting for curious citizens and fire department personnel. 

A really good project made from WCCCA data can be found at [Oregon911.Net](http://www.oregon911.net/) and the repository for that [can be found here](https://github.com/Brandantl/Oregon-911). 

We will also be incorporating the iPhone application and Android application here as well soon.

All products produced will be free of charge and open sourced.
